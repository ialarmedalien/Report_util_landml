    <p>This intended purpose of this app is for downloadable <b>TEXT</b> reports.</p>
    
    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of pretty HTML table,
    either as output from an app or by dragging the object onto the narrative.
    This app serves a different purpose. This app creates one or more files that
    are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or computer scripts.
    The generated comma and tab-delimited columns may look misaligned on the screen
    but they are readable by a spreadsheet or computer program.</p>
     
    <p>This app creates reports on the annotated domains associated with a Genome.
    Short reports will display as TEXT in the Summary section of the output.
    Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new html browser tab.
    In the Files section of the output will be a link for downloading the files. 
    Whether short or long, the Summary/Link section is intended to be a preview
    of the downloadable file. If the report is tab or comma delimited, it may be
    misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script.</p>
    
    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
        <li>The KBase Domain annotation object (output from Domain Annotation app)</li>
        <li>An evalue used to filter out the more distant hits.</li>
        <li>A download option:
        <ul>
            <li>Tab-delimited. A report with tab-delimited columns.</li>
            <li>Comma-delimited. A report with comma-delimited columns.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>The output:
    <ol>
        <li>The frequency count of each Domain in the annotation file. </li>
        <li>Two downloadable files in the <b>Files</b> section:
            <ol>
            <li>A list of the frequency counts (same as the Summary above)</li>
            <li>A list of the genes and their predicted domains. One line per
            gene and domain combination. The list of columns includes the
            identities of the contig, gene, and domain, the location of the
            gene, the E-value of the domain hit, the domain name, and
            higher levels of aggregation for the domain. For example,
            COG0021, has a domain name of 'Transketolase' and is
            categorized in the G category (Carbohydrate transport and metabolism),
            and is part of the general category of METABOLISM.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> This report will include all domains that were in the
    Domain Annotation app output. The app may have included just one
    domain model source (e.g. TIGRFAM) or it many have been all available sources.
    If only one source was included in the annotation app, this report will
    only include that one source.</p>
