    <p>This intended purpose of this app is for downloadable <b>TEXT</b> reports.</p>
    
    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of pretty HTML table,
    either as output from an app or by dragging the object onto the narrative.
    This app serves a different purpose. This app creates one or more files that
    are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or computer scripts.
    </p>
      
    <p>This app creates reports on a Genome.
    Short reports will display as TEXT in the Summary section of the output.
    Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new html browser tab.
    In the Files section of the output will be a link for downloading the files. 
    Whether short or long, the Summary/Link section is intended to be a preview
    of the downloadable file. If the report is tab or comma delimited, it may be
    misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script.</p>
   
    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
        <li>The KBase Genome object (uploaded or output from an app)</li>
        <li>A download option:
        <ul>
            <li>DNA fasta format. Create a fasta file of the genomic DNA.</li>
            <li>Features, Tab-delimited. A report where the rows are the genes in the genome and the columns
            are information about the genes. Columns separated with tabs.</li>
            <li>Features, Comma-delimited. A report where the rows are the genes in the genome and the columns
            are information about the genes. Columns separated with commas.</li>
            <li>Features, GFF3 format. A GFF3 formatted file of the genes in the genome.</li>
            <li>FASTA, translated CDSs. A Fasta-formatted file of the amino acid sequences of the genes.</li>
            <li>FASTA, of mRNAs. A Fasta-formatted file of the mRNA sequences of the genes.</li>           
        </ul></li>        
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>The output:
    <ol>
        <li>The <b>Summary</b> or <b>Link</b> section has text version of the requested file.
       </li>
        <li>One downloadable file in the <b>Files</b> section. The name and content
        of the file will depend on the requested file format.
            <ol>
            <li>FASTA files will be in Fasta format. The file name will end in
            .fna for nucleotide files and .faa for amino acid files.</li>
            <li>Feature lists will include the contig, feature ID, feature type,
            location of the feature, its function, aliases, and RAST functional
            assignment. Tab-delimited files will end in .tab, comma-delimited
            files will end with .csv and GFF files will end with .gff.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
