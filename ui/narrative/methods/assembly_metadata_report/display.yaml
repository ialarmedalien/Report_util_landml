    <p>This intended purpose of this app is for downloadable TEXT reports. Most data objects already have some type of pretty HTML tables,
    either as output from an app or by dragging the object onto the narrative. This app serves a different purpose. Comma and tab-delimited
    columns may look misaligned on the screen because they are for input to a spreadsheet or computer program.</p>
    <p>This app creates reports on the metadata in an Assembly. Short reports will display as TEXT in the Summary section of the output.
    Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new html browser tab. In the Files section of the output will
    be a link for downloading the file. </p>
    <p>The output includes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Metadata: Minimal information. A report on the metadata for the Assembly. </li>
      <li>Listing of the contig descriptions</li>
      <li>OPTIONALLY: the DNA of the contigs in Fasta format. </li>
    </ul>
