    <p>This intended purpose of this app is for downloadable <b>TEXT</b> reports.</p> 
    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of pretty HTML table,
    either as output from an app or by dragging the object onto the narrative.
    This app serves a different purpose. This app creates one or more files that
    are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or computer scripts.
    </p>
    
    <p>This app creates reports on the contents of an Assembly object.
    Short reports will display as TEXT in the Summary section of the output.
    Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new html browser tab.
    In the Files section of the output will be a link for downloading the file. 
    Whether short or long, the Summary/Link section is intended to be a preview
    of the downloadable file. If the report is tab or comma delimited, it may be
    misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script.</p>
  
    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
        <li>The KBase Assembly object (uploaded or output from an app)</li>
        <li>A checkbox for whether or not to include the Fasta of the Assembly.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>The output:
    <ol>
        <li>A <b>Link</b> section with a link
        to the requested report that can be opened in another browser tab.</li>
        <li>One downloadable file in the <b>Files</b> section. The report has
        following sections:
            <ol>
            <li>The metadata of the Assembly object. This includes the
            length of the DNA sequence, the number of contigs, the fraction GC
            content, a taxon reference, and a Fasta handle reference.</li>
            <li>A count of the As, Cs, Gs, and Ts in the Assembly.</li>
            <li>A list of the contigs in the Assembly.
                <ul>
                <li>Contig name (e.g., AKKW01000148)</li>
                <li>Length of the contig</li>
                <li>GC fraction of the contig</li>
                <li>Number of Ns</li>
                <li>Contig ID (can be the same as the name)</li>
                <li>Contig description from the Fasta header line</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>OPTIONALLY: the DNA of the contigs in Fasta format.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
