    <p>This intended purpose of this app is for downloadable <b>TEXT</b> reports.</p>
    
    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of pretty HTML table,
    either as output from an app or by dragging the object onto the narrative.
    This app serves a different purpose. This app creates one or more files that
    are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or computer scripts.
    The generated comma and tab-delimited columns may look misaligned on the screen
    but they are readable by a spreadsheet or computer program.</p>
    
    <p>This app creates reports on the genomes in a GenomeSet.
    Short reports will display as TEXT in the Summary section of the output.
    Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new html browser tab.
    In the Files section of the output will be a link for downloading the file.
    Whether short or long, the Summary/Link section is intended to be a preview
    of the downloadable file. If the report is tab or comma delimited, it may be
    misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script.</p>
    
    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
        <li>The KBase Genome object (uploaded or output from an app)</li>
        <li>A download option:
            <ul>
            <li>Metadata: Minimal information. A report on the metadata
            for GenomeSet. Includes the name, object type, the creator,
            the narrative ID, the description of the GenomeSet, and a list
            of the genome IDs in the Set.</li>
            <li>Vertical. List information on each of the genomes in a
            vertical report instead of columns. Easy to read format but
            more difficult to visually compare one genome to the others.</li>
            <li>Tab-delimited. A report with tab-delimited columns.</li>
            <li>Comma-delimited. A report with comma-delimited columns.</li>
            <li>Fasta. A report with the Fasta of each of the genomes. (REALLY LONG)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>        
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>The output:
    <ol>
        <li>The <b>Summary</b> or <b>Link</b> section has text version of the requested file.
       </li>
        <li>One downloadable file in the <b>Files</b> section. The name and content
        of the file will depend on the requested file format.
            <ol>
            <li>The metadata contains minimum information about the set and
            the genome references that are part of the set.</li>
            <li>FASTA files will be in Fasta format. The file name will end in
            .fna for nucleotide files and .faa for amino acid files.</li>
            <li>The other reports contain summary statistics about the genomes
            in the set. The differences are just in the format of the informat.</li>
            </ol>
